## How it Works?

Swap Google Fonts Display plugin will find all Google Fonts in a webpage and set its font-display to swap

By default browser will wait until the Google Fonts are downloaded to display the font. This is the reason for the error **'ensure text remains visible during webfont load'** in [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)

Luckily Google Fonts now supports setting `font-display` via a new query parameter. By setting `font-display` to swap, the browser uses the fallback font and when downloading actual font is complete, it just swaps the font!

**Note**: Plugin can't add `font-display: swap` to dynamically (via JS) injected Google Fonts

== Installation ==

Just install the plugin and active it. No further configuration is needed.
